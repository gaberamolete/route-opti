    "The goal of optimization is to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions. (Sometimes you'll be satisfied with finding any feasible solution; OR-Tools can do that as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a typical optimization problem. Suppose that a shipping company delivers packages to its customers using a fleet of trucks. Every day, the company must assign packages to trucks, and then choose a route for each truck to deliver its packages. Each possible assignment of packages and routes has a cost, based on the total travel distance for the trucks, and possibly other factors as well. The problem is to choose the assignments of packages and routes that has the least cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all optimization problems, this problem has the following elements:\n",
    "- The **objective** — the quantity you want to optimize. In the example above, the objective is to *minimize cost*. To set up an optimization problem, you need to define a function that calculates the value of the objective for any possible solution. This is called the objective function. In the preceding example, the objective function would calculate the total cost of any assignment of packages and routes. An optimal solution is one for which the value of the objective function is the best. (\"Best\" can be either a maximum or a minimum.)\n",
    "- The **constraints** — restrictions on the set of possible solutions, based on the specific requirements of the problem. For example, if the shipping company can't assign packages above a given weight to trucks, this would impose a constraint on the solutions. A feasible solution is one that satisfies all the given constraints for the problem, without necessarily being optimal.\n",

    "1. The **Simplex algorithm** was the first practical LP algorithm and remains the most popular. The algorithm **walks along the vertices (corner points) of the feasible region**, iteratively improving the value of the objective function until reaching an optimal solution. There are two types of simplex algorithms:\n",
    "    - **Primal simplex** takes steps along the vertices of the **primal feasible region**. This variant is particularly effective at solving a sequence of LP problems with varying objective functions, that is, where the primal feasible region is fixed.\n",
    "    - **Dual simplex** takes steps along the vertices of the **dual feasible region**. This variant is particularly effective at solving a sequence of LP problems where the dual feasible region is fixed, for example, when only bounds on variables change. For this reason, dual simplex is used extensively in MIP solvers.\n",
    "2. **Barrier** or **interior-point** methods were the second practical family of algorithms for LP. Barrier methods **pair theoretical guarantees of efficient (polynomial time) convergence with reliable performance** in practice. They complement the simplex algorithm when it performs poorly; for example, some solvers offer to run both simplex and barrier in parallel, returning the solution from the algorithm that finishes first.\n",
    "3. **First-order methods** are a family of algorithms that **use exclusively gradient information (that is, first-order derivatives) to guide the iterations**. Gradient descent is a well-known example. These methods are popular in nonlinear optimization and machine learning. For LP, first-order methods can scale to larger problems than simplex and barrier, and may also have much smaller memory requirements. On the other thand, they are more sensitive to numerical issues and may struggle to obtain highly accurate solutions.\n",

For example, the duality gap in the simplex algorithm is drivel only by numerical imprecision, while the primal and dual infeasibilities are present even in exact arithmetic. Some methods enforce the bound constraints $ x_1 \\geq 0 $, $ x_2 \\geq 0 $, $ y \\leq 0 $, while others treat violations of bound constraints differently from violations of linear constraints like $ x_1 + x_2 \\leq 1 $. For some solvers, tolerances are *absolute*; that is, there is a parameter $\\epsilon$, and solutions are considered optimal if the duality gap and all primal and dual infeasibilties are less than or equal to $\\epsilon$. For other solvers, tolerances are *relative*, meaning that they scale with the size of the coefficients in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of the effect of tolerances, consider an absolute tolerance of $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2} $ applied to the above primal-dual pair. The solution $ x_1 = 1.5 $, $ x_2 = 0 $, $ y = -3 $ has zero duality gap and infeasibilities are all less than or equal to $\\epsilon$, hence a solver might declare this solution \"optimal\". Yet, its objective value (-3) differs by 1 from the true optimal objective value of -2. Typical default values of $\\epsilon$ are between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-8}$, which makes such extreme examples rare but not impossible."
