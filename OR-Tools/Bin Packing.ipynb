    "The goal of *packing* problems is to find the best way to **pack a set of items of given sizes into containers with fixed capacities**. A typical application is loading boxes onto delivery trucks efficiently. Often, it's not possible to pack all the items, due to the capacity constraints. In that case, the problem is to find a subset of the items with maximum total size that will fit in the containers.\n",

    "OR-Tools provides several solvers for knapsack problems in its algorithms library. There are also more general versions of the knapsack problem. Here are a couple of examples:\n",
    "- **Multidimensional knapsack problems**, in which the **items have more than one physical quantity**, such as weight and volume, and the **knapsack has a capacity for each quantity**. Here, the term dimension does not necessarily refer to the usual spatial dimensions of height, length, and width. However, some problems might involve spatial dimensions, for example, finding the optimal way to pack rectangular boxes into a rectangular storage bin.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference between the multiple knapsack problem and the bin-packing problem. Suppose a company has delivery trucks, each of which has an 18,000 pound weight capacity, and 130,000 pounds of items to deliver.\n",

    "The constraints are the following:\n",
    "- Each item must be placed in exactly one bin. This constraint is set by requiring that the sum of `x[i][j]` over all bins `j` is equal to 1. Note that this differs from the multiple knapsack problem, in which the sum is only required to be less than or equal to 1, because not all items have to be packed.\n",
    "- The total weight packed in each bin can't exceed its capacity. This is the same constraint as in the multiple knapsack problem, but in this case you multiply the bin capacity on the right side of the inequalities by `y[j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why multiply by `y[j]`? Because it forces `y[j]` to equal 1 if any item is packed in bin `j`. This is so because if `y[j]` were 0, the right side of the inequality would be 0, while the bin weight on the left side would be greater than 0, violating the constraint. This connects the variables `y[j]` to the objective of the problem, for now the solver will try to minimize the number of bins for which `y[j]` is 1."
