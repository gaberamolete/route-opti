    "One of the most well-known combinatorial optimization problems is the assignment problem. Here's an example: suppose a group of workers needs to perform a set of tasks, and for each worker and task, there is a cost for assigning the worker to the task. The problem is to assign each worker to at most one task, with no two workers performing the same task, while minimizing the total cost.\n",

    "You can visualize this problem by the graph below, in which there are four workers and four tasks. The edges represent all possible ways to assign workers to tasks. The labels on the edges are the costs of assigning workers to tasks.\n",

    "There is a well-known result in graph theory, called [The Marriage Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%27s_marriage_theorem), which tells us **exactly when you can assign each node on the left to a distinct node on the right, in a bipartite graph** like the one above. Such an assignment is called a *perfect matching*. In a nutshell, the theorem says this is possible if there is **no subset of nodes on the left (like the one in the previous example) whose edges lead to a smaller set of nodes on the right**.\n",
